        <h2> About</h2>
        <br>
        <p> Born on the island of Motunui. Moana is the tribe's chief's daughter. She sets out for a famous island with
            the demigod Maui, coming from a line of voyagers. Along the way, they face everything the ocean has to offer
            while discovering the power of perseverance and faith.
            Embarking on a risky expedition to save her people, a brave youngster sets sail. <br><br>
            The once-powerful demigod
            Maui, who Moana encounters along the road, helps her on her quest to become a skilled wayfinder. Together,
            they embark on an action-packed journey across the ocean while battling impossibly difficult circumstances
            and monstrous monsters. Along the way, Moana completes the illustrious quest of her ancestors and learns the
            one thing she has always sought: her own identity.A sea-loving, independent traveler, Moana. Even though she
            experiences self-doubt occasionally, she takes
            great pleasure in who she is and isn't afraid to take on new challenges. She takes on new challenges and
            responsibilities with the utmost seriousness, and even when everything appears lost, she will maintain her
            ground and fight for what she cherishes. </p>

        <h2> Personality and Habits</h2>
        <br>

        <p>Moana is vibrant. She enjoys the sea and is fearless and physically capable. Though she has moments of
            self-doubt, she is too stubborn to back down from something new. Moana can present herself as strong despite
            her size.<br><br>
            Moana "stands out from the crowd," as Gramma Tala describes it. She adores the water, is fearless, and
            physically capable. Though she has moments of self-doubt, she is generally too stubborn to back down from
            new endeavors. Moana takes new experiences and tasks seriously and will battle for what she cherishes even
            when everything appears to be lost. Despite her lack of experience outside of Motunui, Moana may present
            herself as an imposing force despite her small stature, having defeated the most terrifying monsters and
            inconceivable hurdles across Oceania's oceans while depending almost entirely on her own cleverness.

        <h2> Knowledge and Skills</h2>
        <br>
        <p>Though Moana does not possess the ability to bend water to her will, she does share a unique and exclusive
            relationship with the ocean itself. When Moana needs help, she can rely on the water. When she first set
            sail to
            travel beyond the reef, her sailing skills were lacking, and she was nearly killed by the fierce currents.
            <br>
            Despite the challenges she faced on her journey, Moana refused to give up and continued going with her
            strength
            and bravery. She musters the strength to confront the lava demon alone. She developed throughout her
            experience.<br><br>
            Her enthusiasm and perseverance are contagious as she befriends Maui, the self-absorbed wind and sea
            demigod. By the end of the movie, Moana has won everyone's heart because she is a selfless leader – a
            servant leader. She is motivated not only by a desire to aid her people, but also by a desire to restore
            equilibrium. Moana is one of my favorite Disney characters of all time because she taught me the value of
            conscientious leadership, which is very important .

        <h2> Family and friends</h2>
        <br>

        <p>Moana is the daughter of Chief Tui and Sina. Chief Tui's mother and Moana's grandmother is Gramma Tala. Tala
            was
            known as the "village crazy lady" due to her interest in ancient myths and legends. Tala, her granddaughter,
            has
            a love for water and exploring. Moana is chosen by the ocean to travel the sea and save the world with the
            help
            of the shape-shifting demigod Maui.
            <br><br>
            Moana had no idea that her ancestors were voyagers until she learned this from Grandma Tala. Learning her
            ancestors’ history validated Moana’s desire to go beyond the reef and save her people. You could visibly see
            the joy in her eyes as she discovered not only the truth of her ancestors but of the understanding of where
            her love for the Ocean comes from.

        <h2>Favorite Quote</h2>
        <p>
            <b><i>“Sometimes our strengths lie beneath the surface... Far beneath, in some cases.”</i></b> The quote
            encompasses so much. Nothing in life is definite, but anything is possible if you are willing to work hard
            and
            make some sacrifices along the way.

            We all have strength within us, but it takes a little more effort to find it. 3
